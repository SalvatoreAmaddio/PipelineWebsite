This console line application is a quick solution for a Client of mine who needed to extract data from their website and print them onto a spreadsheet.
For privacy purposes, some information has been omitted such as:
- Login Details
- Website Links
- Records information to retrieve.

Therefore, if you would try to debug this code, it won't work.

Yet you can see how I have approached the problem.
